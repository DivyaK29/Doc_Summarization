## Modules

### Python Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages, which are listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **langchain**: A library designed for building applications with language models.

Ensure these packages are installed in your Python environment to support the project's functionality.

### Java Components
The project contains a Java class `SimpleCalculator` in the file `sam.java`. This class provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two integer inputs. It includes methods to perform each operation and a `main` method that demonstrates usage by performing these operations on the numbers 10 and 5, printing the results to the console. The division method also handles division-by-zero cases by printing an error message and returning 0.

### Python Scripts
The `sample.py` file defines a simple function `add` that takes two arguments and returns their sum. The script assigns the values 5 and 10 to variables `a` and `b`, respectively, and prints the result of adding these two numbers using the `add` function.
