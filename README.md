# SimpleCalculator: A Java-based Utility for Basic Arithmetic Operations

This documentation details the `SimpleCalculator` class implemented in `sam.java`, which serves as a straightforward tool for performing fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class is designed for ease of use, with static methods that ensure quick access to the functionality without the need to create an instance of the class. Additionally, the class incorporates error handling for division scenarios, specifically addressing potential division by zero errors. 

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:
- `sam.java`: Contains the `SimpleCalculator` class implementation, which provides static methods for performing basic arithmetic operations. The class defines four methods: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, each accepting two integer parameters and returning the result. The `divide` method handles division by zero by printing an error message and returning zero.
- `README.md`: This documentation file with essential information and usage instructions.

## Usage

The provided `main` method within `sam.java` serves as an illustrative example of how the `SimpleCalculator` class can be utilized to perform calculations between two integers. For instance, it demonstrates addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using predefined integers (10 and 5) and prints the output for each operation.

## Example

Here's a quick look at how you might use the `SimpleCalculator` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + SimpleCalculator.add(a, b));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + SimpleCalculator.subtract(a, b));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + SimpleCalculator.multiply(a, b));
        System.out.println("Division: " + SimpleCalculator.divide(a, b));
    }
}
```

This example calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers 10 and 5, showcasing how each operation can be performed using the `SimpleCalculator` class.
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Updated the description of the `sam.java` file to reflect the purpose and methods of the `SimpleCalculator` class.
- Ensured all references to the deleted `sample.py` file were removed, as it is no longer part of the documentation.
- Maintained the structure and tone of the original document while incorporating the requested updates.
