# # Comprehensive Guide to the SimpleCalculator Java Application: Basic Arithmetic Operations and Usage Documentation



 To perform the necessary modifications to the README.md file based on the provided updates and deletions, I will implement the following changes:

### Modified README.md

```markdown
# Project Title

## Overview

This project contains implementations of simple arithmetic operations in different programming languages.

## Modules

### `sam.java`
The purpose of the `SimpleCalculator` class in the provided Java code file is to perform basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two integer inputs. The class contains four static methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`) that implement these operations, with the `divide` method including a check to avoid division by zero. In the `main` method, the code demonstrates the use of these methods by performing calculations with two predefined integers, `x` and `y`, and printing the results to the console.

### `sample.py`
The purpose of the code file `sample.py` is to define a simple function called `add` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The file then initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with values 5 and 10, respectively, and it prints the result of calling the `add` function with these two variables as arguments, which outputs the sum (15) to the console.

## Usage

To run the Java code, ensure that you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, and execute `sam.java` with your preferred IDE or command line.

In Python, you can run `sample.py` directly using Python 3.

```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Updated Sections**: Added summaries for `sam.java` and `sample.py` under the "Modules" section to describe their purpose and functionality.
2. **No Deletions**: Since there are no deleted files or changes required based on deletions, the relevant content remains intact.

These modifications ensure that the README accurately reflects the current state of the project files while preserving its overall structure and tone.
