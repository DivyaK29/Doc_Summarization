## Modules

### Python Dependencies

This project requires certain Python libraries for data manipulation and language model applications. These dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. It includes:

- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- `langchain`: Used for building applications with language models.

You can install these dependencies easily using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Java Calculator

The project includes a simple calculator implemented in Java, provided in the `sam.java` file. The `SimpleCalculator` class contains static methods for basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (handles division-by-zero with an error message)

The `main` method demonstrates these operations with example inputs, outputting results to the console.

### Python Sample Function

The `sample.py` file defines a simple Python function `add` that takes two arguments and returns their sum. The script demonstrates this function by adding two predefined numbers (5 and 10) and printing the result.
